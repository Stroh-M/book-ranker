# Book Ranker

## Overview
**Book Ranker** is a web application that allows users to log books they've read, add personal notes, and rank each book based on their own criteria. With a simple, user-friendly interface built using EJS templates, Book Ranker provides an easy way to track reading history, jot down insights, and create personalized ratings for each title.

## Features
- **Book Log**: Users can upload books they’ve read and see them all in one list.
- **Personal Notes**: Each book entry can include personal notes to capture thoughts, quotes, or memorable moments.
- **Ranking System**: Books can be ranked according to the user’s preference, offering a customizable rating system.

## Database Setup
The project uses PostgreSQL to store data, and the database structure needs to match the one originally set up for Book Ranker. If you're interested in replicating or learning more about the database configuration, please reach out.
